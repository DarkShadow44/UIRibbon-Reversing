images don't work with png, want bmp
paint bmps work fine, created by me doesn't. not sure what's wrong.


<Scale Group="Test2" Size="Small"> compiles "for FourButtons", but not "MySize1" - small is only possible when small is different from medium...
<Scale Group="Test2" Size="Small"> doesn't change anything (might only work for automatic sizing, use ScalingPolicy.IdealSizes for the rest

imageformat: bmp3 with alphachannel
convert df.bmp -define bmp:format=bmp3 -define bmp3:alpha=true f.bmp


copy commands somewhere, to reuse (strings + images)

ScalingPolicy.IdealSizes small forces always small, ScalingPolicy.IdealSizes medium forces always medium or lower ?!? - default image small?
without scalingpolicy, always large


need scaling tests for all controls, all scalings

default sizedefinitions - or size when no sizedefinition present
scalingtests for all controls + tabs
fixme for unhandled blocks
colordropdown vs combobox

test ControlGroup in group
predefined sizedefinitions

write defaults into .ksy ?

- where fontcontrol images come from? - maybe just apply them by their ID, and register their ID as special commands - maybe have ids + subcontrol list... - link commandinfo, maybe put that info in there?
- transform commandhandlers, put info about special commands for fontdropdown into there
- fontcontrol subcontrols as list inside fontcontrol? - need to be able to apply sizedefinition order

test old (win7) UICC format
helpbutton
DynamicUI??
QuickAccessToolbar
test against paint/wordpad
